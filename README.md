### Intro

This is a video game based on Borland Graphics Interface in DOS system, a project with 3000 lines of codes.

Players are moving around the map, strategically placing bombs to kill enemies and destroy obstacles. 
The game has two modes, human v.s. human, and human v.s. computer. The non-player character has very
clever strategy. Get prepared before challenging the “Hard” computer.

There are lots of power-ups and special equipment all around the map, for you to discover ;)
