### Intro

Above is a video clip showing the gameplay. The game contains 3000 lines of codes, and was built with Borland Graphics Interface in DOS system.

Players are moving around the map, strategically placing bombs to kill enemies and destroy obstacles. 
The game has two modes, human v.s. human, and human v.s. computer. The non-player character has very
clever strategy. Get prepared before challenging the “Hard” computer.

There are lots of power-ups and special equipment all around the map, for you to discover ;)
